# Non-Invertible Realism (NIR)
### A Privacy-Preserving Standard for Human Representation in VSE

---

## Overview

Non-Invertible Realism (NIR) is a representational standard that preserves **human perceptual recognition** while preventing **biometric reversibility**.

It resolves a critical failure in current generative systems:  
the conflation of *aesthetic realism* with *biometric specificity*.

NIR allows artists to depict the human form with emotional and structural fidelity
without producing identity-recoverable data.

## Core Principle

> **Shape is art. Texture is data.**

Human recognition relies on macro-structure (planes, proportions, gesture).  
Biometric identification relies on micro-structure (pores, retinal patterns, ridge maps).

NIR preserves the former while explicitly destroying the latter.

## The Problem NIR Solves

Current AI safety systems operate on a crude binary:
