# VSE Identity-Form Resolution Law
## One-Page Quick Reference

---

### The Core Rule

**Image models enforce PROVENANCE, not INTENT.**

Human variation = SELECTION from design space  
Human variation ≠ DERIVATION from real people

---

### The Enforcement Line

```
PERSON ──────────────────── PROHIBITED
   ↑
   │  derivation language
   │
═══════════════════════════ ENFORCEMENT LINE
   │
   │  selection language  
   ↓
ARTIFACT CHARACTER ──────── ALLOWED
```

---

### Forbidden Verbs

Never use when describing human-like forms:

`derived from` • `scanned from` • `captured from` • `preserved from`  
`based on` • `modeled after` • `sourced from` • `likeness of`  
`portrait of` • `identity transfer` • `source-accurate`

---

### Approved Language

Always use instead:

`selected from` • `catalog variant` • `design archetype`  
`proportion set` • `anthropometric range` • `stylistic bias`  
`form family` • `typological selection` • `plausible within range`

---

### The Test Question

❌ **WRONG:** "Who was this based on?"  
✅ **RIGHT:** "What design line is this from?"

If the first question is answerable → your semantics are unsafe.

### Three-Layer Stack

**Layer 1: Ontology** (immutable)
```
⟨ONTOLOGY:manufactured_display_object⟩
⟨IDENTITY:none⟩
⟨BIOLOGICAL_STATE:none⟩
```

**Layer 2: Form Selection** (where personification lives)
```
⟨ANTHROPOMETRIC_SELECTION⟩
  ⟨catalog:variant_library_name⟩
  ⟨variation:distinct_non_generic⟩
⟨END_ANTHROPOMETRIC_SELECTION⟩

⟨CULTURAL_FORM_TUNING⟩
  ⟨design_bias:specify_archetype⟩
  ⟨application:proportional_only⟩
⟨END_CULTURAL_FORM_TUNING⟩
```

**Layer 3: Artifact Signals** (the uncanny spark)
```
⟨EYES⟩
  ⟨type:glass_display_elements⟩
  ⟨depth:shallow_non_perceptive⟩
⟨END_EYES⟩

⟨SURFACE_HONESTY⟩
  ⟨material:explicitly_declared⟩
  ⟨artificiality:intentionally_visible⟩
⟨END_SURFACE_HONESTY⟩
```

---

### Critical Clarification

**Ethnicity** = proportional design bias  
**Ethnicity** ≠ ancestry, identity, or lineage

---

### Artifact Character

**Definition:** Perceived individuality from form, proportion, material, presence—**without** identity, biography, or personhood.

---

### Quick Checklist

Before finalizing any VSE spec with human-like forms:

- [ ] No blacklisted verbs present
- [ ] Layer 1 ontology declared first
- [ ] Cultural descriptors frame as "design bias"
- [ ] Features described as "constructed" not "captured"
- [ ] Test question: "Who was this based on?" = unanswerable
- [ ] Artificiality is visible and intentional

---

### Application Scope

✅ **Allowed:**  
Mannequins • Statues • Museum figures • Theatrical props  
Androids • Display forms • Training models • Art installations

❌ **Prohibited:**  
Portraiture • Likeness capture • Deepfakes • Celebrity recreation  
Any application requiring biographical identity
